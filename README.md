# Sales Management System (MySQL Project)

## Introduction
Sales management plays a crucial role in every business by tracking customers, products, and orders efficiently.  
A digital Sales Management System ensures quick access to accurate information, supports better decision-making, and prevents data loss or manual errors.  

Traditional record-keeping (like spreadsheets or paper-based logs) can be time-consuming and unreliable.  
By implementing this system using MySQL, sales data can be stored, managed, and analyzed in a structured and secure way.
